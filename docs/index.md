# Data2paper



##  What is data2paper?

Data2paper is a cloud-based application to automate the process of  compiling and submitting a data paper to a journal without the  researcher having to leave the research space or wrestle directly with  the journal’s submission system.



##  Current status

Part of Jisc’s Research Data Spring initiative, data2Paper completed  Phase 4 of the project in 2018. We built a live end-to-end workflow of  data2paper for testing with real authors, data sets, repositories and  journals. We’ve built on work done by the [WDS-RDA Publishing Data Workflow Working Group](https://zenodo.org/record/56789?ln=en#.V5x4r1fz6n9) on data publishing, run a survey for stakeholders to establish the baseline demand, and produced a [demostration video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCoCvcHij6Y) (so far silent) .
